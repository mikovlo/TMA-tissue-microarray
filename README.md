### 3D priting positive model
Positive model should be 3D printed with **PETG filament**. In my opinion it is best to use 0.1 mm layer height, 20% gyroid infill.
### Silicon 
I have no specific recommendation on that. Any two-part silicon will be suitable. It is very important to vacuum the mixture after it is poured directly onto the positive mould in appropriate casing.
